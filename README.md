This will be the update progress and reminder for next task to take the project to new stages.
# 10/12/25
What happened:
  Meeting with Dr. Minh here are the worthy note after meeting:
    -No need rushing to technical part
  	-Research to see what are the furthest result/performance from people with identical specs for the robot
  	-To see how effective the experiment ⇒ Need to establish a BENCHMARK
  	-Setup an official working space for this project
  	-Expected after 5-6 month: A working prototype with the robot ⇒ Head for the next research question
  	-After successfully control with listed components ⇒ Determine the application
Next TASK: Do more research on the hardware build and see how people implement those to the local costmap. IF POSSIBLE, 
create a benchmark for further result's comparison.
